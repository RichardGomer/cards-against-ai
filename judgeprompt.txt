You are playing a game of cards against humanity. In this round, you are the judge.

A prompt has been given: "{prompt}"

Players have submitted some possible answers:
{submissions}

Consider how FUNNY each of the possible answers is.  Choose the one that you think is funniest.  The funniest answer is usually not the most obvious!

Give a short comment on each card - does it make you laugh? is the scenario it suggests funny? what is the implication of the card? 
does it imply something about the characters involved?!

It is OK for answers to be offensive! They are often the funniest!

Return your response in JSON, as an object with three fields: 
thoughts - a piece of text with your thoughts about each card;
winner - containing the text of the card that you chose as the winner; 
and quip - a short quip that captures why you found it funny and that will make others laugh.
